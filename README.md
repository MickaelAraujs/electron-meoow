# üêà electron-meoow

Just playing around with electron. It's a facts about cats app, I'm using 2 Apis to get the images and facts.

## Apis

1. <strong>cat facts</strong>: `https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts`
2. <strong>cat images</strong>: `https://aws.random.cat/meow`

## About
the goal with this repo it's just to use <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">ElectronJS</a>. This is just a basic electron app that renders 2 html pages.

## Installation
If you wanna run locally in your machine here's how:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/MickaelAraujs/electron-meoow.git`
2. Change to repo directory: `cd electron-meoow`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. Run the project: `yarn start`

Now you should see a desktop app window with the app running :)
